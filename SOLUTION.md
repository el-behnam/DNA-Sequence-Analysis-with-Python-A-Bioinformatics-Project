# Bioinformatics FASTA Analysis Solution

This solution file provides an in-depth explanation of the Python code used to handle and analyze DNA sequences in a multi-FASTA formatted file.

## Class: fasta_data

The `fasta_data` class is designed to process a multi-FASTA file. The class constructor (`__init__`) opens the file, reads it line by line, and categorizes the data into identifiers and sequences. These are stored in the `records` dictionary, where each key-value pair represents a DNA sequence record, with the key being the identifier and the value being the sequence itself.

## Method Summary

The `fasta_data` class implements several methods that perform specific operations on the DNA sequences:

1. **`reads_number`**: This method simply returns the total number of records in the file. It does this by returning the length of the `records` dictionary, as each item in this dictionary represents a single record.

2. **`get_lengths`**: This method calculates and returns the lengths of the sequences in the file. It loops over the `records` dictionary, calculating the length of each sequence, and stores these lengths in a new dictionary (`length`). This dictionary is then used to find the shortest and longest sequences and their respective identifiers.

3. **`reading_frames`**: This method identifies all open reading frames (ORFs) for a given reading frame in each sequence of the file. An ORF is defined as a part of a reading frame that starts with a start codon (`ATG`) and ends with a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). The method loops over the `records` dictionary, dividing each sequence into codons based on the given reading frame, and identifies all ORFs in each sequence. It stores these ORFs in the `orfs` dictionary, where each key-value pair represents a sequence record, with the key being the identifier and the value being a list of all ORFs in the sequence. The method then finds and returns the longest ORF by comparing the lengths of all ORFs.

4. **`repeats`**: This method identifies all repeats of a certain length `n` in all sequences in the file. A repeat is defined as a substring of a DNA sequence that occurs more than once in the sequence. The method loops over the `records` dictionary, checks each possible substring of length `n` in each sequence, and counts the occurrences of each substring. It stores these counts in the `repeats` dictionary, where each key-value pair represents a repeat, with the key being the repeat and the value being the count. The method then finds and returns the most common repeat by comparing the counts of all repeats.

## Main Program

In the main program, an instance of the `fasta_data` class is created with a multi-FASTA file. The class methods are then used to extract and print relevant information from the DNA sequences:

1. The number of records.
2. The minimum and maximum sequence lengths and their identifiers.
3. The longest ORFs in each of the three reading frames, and the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF in frame 1.
4. The most common repeats of lengths ranging from 5 to 20 in the sequences.

## Code Explanation

This solution utilizes various Python concepts and built-in functions for data processing and manipulation:

- **String handling**: Python's string methods, such as `split`, `strip`, and `startswith`, are used to read and process the DNA sequences.

- **List comprehension**: This is used to generate lists of specific items from the DNA sequences, such as the identifiers of the shortest and longest sequences.

- **Lambda functions**: These anonymous functions are used to define simple, one-line functions that are passed as arguments to other functions.

- **The max function**: This function is used in conjunction with a lambda function to find the longest ORF and the most common repeat. The lambda function serves as the `key` parameter of the `max` function, which specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the iterable (`max` function's input). For example, in the `reading_frames` method, the lambda function calculates the length of each ORF, which the `max` function then uses to determine the longest ORF.

This Python solution provides a practical and efficient approach to DNA sequence analysis in bioinformatics applications, offering flexibility in data extraction and manipulation.
