# Bioinformatics FASTA Analysis Solution

This solution file documents the implementation details of the provided Python class and its methods for handling and analyzing DNA sequences in the multi-FASTA format. 

## Class: fasta_data

The `fasta_data` class reads and processes a multi-FASTA file, breaking down each sequence into a dictionary with the sequence identifier as the key and the DNA sequence as the value.

## Method Summary

The `fasta_data` class implements the following methods:

1. **`reads_number`**: Returns the total number of records in the file.
2. **`get_lengths`**: Returns the lengths of the sequences in the file, including the shortest and longest sequences, and their respective identifiers.
3. **`reading_frames`**: Identifies all open reading frames (ORFs) in each sequence for a given reading frame and finds the longest ORF.
4. **`repeats`**: Identifies all repeats of a given length `n` in all sequences and finds the most common repeat.

## Main Program

In the main program, an instance of the `fasta_data` class is created with a multi-FASTA file. The class methods are then used to print the following information:

1. The number of records.
2. The minimum and maximum sequence lengths and their identifiers.
3. The longest ORFs in each of the three reading frames and the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF in frame 1.
4. The most common repeats of lengths ranging from 5 to 20 in the sequences.

## Code Explanation

The code uses basic Python string handling and list comprehension techniques to process the sequences. It also uses the `max` function with a custom key function (`lambda`) to find the longest ORF and the most common repeat. The key function specifies how to calculate the "value" for each item that the `max` function should compare.

For instance, in the `reading_frames` method, the key function `lambda x: x[1] - x[0]` calculates the length of each ORF (stop position - start position), and the `max` function then returns the ORF with the maximum length.

In the `repeats` method, the key function `lambda x: x[1]` returns the count of each repeat, and the `max` function then returns the repeat with the maximum count.

This Python solution provides a flexible and efficient way to analyze DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format for bioinformatics applications.
